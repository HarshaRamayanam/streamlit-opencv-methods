# Demonstrating some useful methods of OpenCV-Python in live action

## About:

This is a personal project built in python3 to demonstrate some useful methods of `opencv` library and how they work in live action using `streamlit`.

## Instructions:

Make sure you have the following installed:

`pip install opencv-python`

`pip install streamlit`

After installing, open up your terminal and `cd` into the directory where you have saved the file and run the follwing command.

`$> streamlit run opencv_useful_methods.py`

This will open up your web browser. Upload an image and play with the methods provided by OpenCV
